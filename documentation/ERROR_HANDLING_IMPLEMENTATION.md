# Error Handling

Frontend and backend error handling.

**Full reference:** [`info.md`](info.md)


## Current system behavior

Lab Door Customs is a monorepo: React/Vite storefront (`frontend/`), Express API (`backend/`), Vitest + Playwright tests (`Tests/`). Production runs one Express process serving `/api/*` and the built SPA; PostgreSQL is Supabase with backend **service_role** access — RLS and revoked grants block `anon`/`authenticated` PostgREST on 14 tables.

| Area | How it works |
|------|----------------|
| **Checkout** | Cart validation with retry; `policy_accepted` required; **Place Order** → `POST /api/checkout/place-order` → WhatsApp redirect (`Order ID` in message = `orders.id` UUID); checkout email synced to activity on change/blur. |
| **Admin** | Bulk updates max **500** IDs; manual mark paid verifies PayPal capture via API; paid orders cannot cancel without refund; product cards on mobile. |
| **Activity** | `POST /api/activity/batch` is CSRF-exempt and rate-limited; frontend sends only with analytics cookie consent; IPs anonymized with `IP_SALT`. |
| **Reviews** | Public responses strip PII (`toPublicReview()`); admin shows email. Eligibility via `POST /api/reviews/check` (email in body). Votes on approved reviews only. |
| **Mobile** | Sticky CTAs with keyboard lift on checkout; cookie banner top on purchase routes; cart stacked CTA at 320px; OOS hides product sticky bar; admin product cards on phones. |

Authoritative reference: [`info.md`](info.md). Production requires `ORDER_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `IP_SALT`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.

## Backend

- Structured JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- `respond500()` / `clientErrorMessage()` in `backend/src/lib/safeError.ts` — route catch blocks return generic messages in production (full `Error.message` only in development)
- Pino logging with request IDs (`X-Request-Id`)
- Sentry capture for unhandled errors in production
- PayPal errors mapped to client-safe messages

## Frontend

- `apiFetch` wrapper with timeout, CSRF retry, credential handling
- Sonner toasts for user-facing errors
- Sentry browser SDK in production
- Graceful fallbacks for network failures
