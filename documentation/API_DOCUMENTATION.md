# REST API Documentation

**Authoritative reference:** [`info.md`](info.md)

Base URL: `{VITE_API_BASE_URL}` (default local: `http://localhost:5000/api`)

Mutating requests require CSRF token (`X-CSRF-Token` header + cookie) except PayPal webhooks and `POST /activity/batch` (CSRF-exempt for `sendBeacon`; rate-limited).

---

## Authentication

| Actor | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Admin | HttpOnly `admin_session` cookie after `POST /api/admin/login` |
| Customer orders | `X-Order-Access-Token` header; PayPal return uses one-time `?code=` exchanged via `/paypal/checkout-exchange/:code`; alternate recovery via `?aid=` |
| Public | No auth (rate-limited) |

---

## Health and CSRF

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Public | Redirects to `/api/health` |
| GET | `/api/health` | Public | DB latency, pool stats, Redis status, PayPal mode, uptime. Returns **503** in production when Redis is required but disconnected. |
| GET | `/csrf-token` | Public | Returns CSRF token for SPA init |

---

## PayPal (server.ts)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/paypal/webhook` | PayPal signature | Webhook handler (raw JSON body) |
| POST | `/paypal/create-payment` | Public + CSRF | Create pending order + PayPal checkout |
| POST | `/paypal/capture-payment/:orderId` | Order token + CSRF | Capture approved payment; **409** if PayPal succeeds but order is not `payment_status=completed` |
| GET | `/paypal/checkout-exchange/:code` | Public | Atomically redeem one-time checkout code → `accessToken` |
| GET | `/paypal/checkout-context/:paypalOrderId` | Order token | Checkout recovery when exchange code is unavailable |
| POST | `/paypal/refund/:captureId` | Admin | Refund capture (partial or full) |
| GET | `/paypal/test` | Admin | PayPal connectivity test |
| GET | `/paypal/order/:orderId` | Admin | Fetch PayPal order details |

### Create payment body

```json
{
  "customerInfo": { "fullName", "email", "phone", "address", "city", "state", "zipCode", "country" },
  "items": [{ "product_id", "quantity", "size_system", "size_value" }],
  "coupon_code": "optional",
  "amount": "optional client total for validation"
}
```

Headers: `X-Idempotency-Key` (optional), `X-CSRF-Token`

**Response:** PayPal approval links and `serverOrderId`. The order access token is **not** returned — the customer redeems a one-time checkout exchange code on the payment success page.

**PayPal return URL:** `{FRONTEND_URL}/payment/success?code={exchangeCode}` — PayPal appends `&token={paypalOrderId}`.

### Checkout exchange

`GET /paypal/checkout-exchange/:code` redeems the `code` from the PayPal return URL. Each code is single-use, expires in 30 minutes, and is stored hashed in `order_checkout_exchanges`. The associated access token is encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). A successful redeem returns `accessToken`, `serverOrderId`, order totals, and coupon context.

### Capture payment body

```json
{
  "serverOrderId": "uuid",
  "accessToken": "64-char hex",
  "couponId": "optional",
  "discount_amount": 0
}
```

Headers: `X-Idempotency-Key` (PayPal order ID or client key), `X-CSRF-Token`

### PayPal webhooks

`POST /paypal/webhook` uses a raw JSON body parser (registered before `express.json()`). Signatures are verified via PayPal API when `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` is set.

| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED` | Resolve capture amount from payload or PayPal API; complete order with amount validation; auto-refund on mismatch. Returns **500** when order binding or capture application fails (PayPal retries). |
| `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED` | Cancel pending order, restore stock |
| `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED` / `REVERSED` | Sync refund to DB with deduplication |

## Response format

Success:

{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }
```

Error:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "message", "message": "details" }
```

---

## Rate limits

Applied per IP. Uses Redis when `REDIS_URL` is set; in production, rate limiting fails closed if Redis is required but unavailable. Notable limits:

- Admin login: 5 attempts / 15 minutes
- Contact, reviews (submit/vote/admin), coupon validate: per-route limits
- Payment endpoints: dedicated limiter (webhooks excluded)
- Order lookup (`POST /orders/lookup`), product search (`POST /products/search`), checkout exchange redeem (`GET /paypal/checkout-exchange/:code`), review eligibility check

---

## Pagination

List endpoints return:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": { "page", "limit", "total", "totalPages" }
}
```
