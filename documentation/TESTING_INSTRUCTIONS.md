# Testing Instructions

This content has moved to **[test_guidelines.md](test_guidelines.md)**.

That file is the single reference for:

- When to run tests (including the policy to run only when explicitly requested)
- Automated tests (Vitest, Playwright, link checker)
- CI pipeline
- Manual QA checklists and test flows
- Health and build verification
- Troubleshooting and adding new tests

## Current system behavior

Lab Door Customs is a monorepo: React/Vite storefront (`frontend/`), Express API (`backend/`), Vitest + Playwright tests (`Tests/`). Production runs one Express process serving `/api/*` and the built SPA; PostgreSQL is Supabase with backend **service_role** access — RLS and revoked grants block `anon`/`authenticated` PostgREST on 13 tables.

| Area | How it works |
|------|----------------|
| **Checkout** | Cart validation with retry; PayPal `?code=` exchange; capture **409** → processing UI; checkout email synced to activity on change/blur. |
| **Orders** | Email links `GET /api/orders/access-exchange/:code`; legacy `?orderNumber=&token=` stripped; partial refresh keeps stale data + warning. 
| **Admin** | Products paginated (load more); messages mark read on open; coupons scope UI; reviews admin response; estimated delivery; error/retry states. |
| **Activity** | Consent-gated batch; `contact_submit` on contact success. |
| **Reviews** | `POST /api/reviews/check` on email blur; pending-moderation copy; vote error toasts. |
| **Mobile** | Sticky CTAs with keyboard lift on checkout; cookie banner top on purchase routes; cart stacked CTA at 320px; OOS hides product sticky bar; admin product cards on phones. |

Authoritative reference: [`info.md`](info.md). Production requires `ORDER_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `IP_SALT`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.
